    <H1>Review of Here To Stay by Mark Edwards</H1>
    <!--Try to summarize without giving it away-->
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Here to Stay is about a happy, successful young man who purchased and renovated a beautiful old home in an upper
        middle
        class neighborhood just outside London. Well, he was happy until the Robinson’s moved in.
    </p>
    <p>When Elliot met Gemma Robinson his world was turned upside down. It became a whirlwind romance and within weeks
        they
        were married and living in the home that Elliot considered his pride and joy.
    </p>
    <p>Gemma’s parents and sister came to stay with them shortly after they were married, for what Gemma said would be a
        couple
        of weeks, and that’s when the never-ending torment begins.</p>
    <p>If you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to live with your in-laws, it’s nothing compared to what Elliot and
        Gemma face in this scary novel. We’re not just talking privacy, kitchen privileges and bathroom sharing issues
        here. <b>This is your worst nightmare!</b></p>

    <h3>True Happiness?</h3>
    <p>This quote by Elliot explains his reasoning for getting married. This would normally be way out of his “reserved
        Englishman” comfort zone. <q>Listen, I know you’re going to say it’s too quick. That’s what everyone is going to
            say. But I’m not going to change my
            mind. You know when I was stung by the bee? I made a vow to myself then that I wasn’t going to waste time
            anymore. I wasn’t going to allow fear or doubt to rule me. She makes me happy, Amira. So happy.</q></p>
